# Smart Platform

## Overview

Smart Platform is a prototype web application designed to enhance the educational experience for teachers and students. It facilitates knowledge sharing and the publishing of academic work, leveraging a modular architecture where each application component offers dedicated REST APIs. Developed with Django, the platform aims for scalability and ease of use, providing a robust framework for educational content management and collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Application Design**: Organized into distinct applications, each serving specific functionality through RESTful APIs.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tools and interfaces designed to promote the sharing of educational content among users.
- **Content Publishing**: Enables teachers and students to publish their academic work, making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Plans for further scalability include service separation, dedicated databases, reverse proxy integration, and message queue communication.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Django
- **APIs**: Django Rest Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for robust, scalable data storage solutions
- **Web Server**: Nginx, configured for HTTPS, ensuring secure, encrypted communications
- **Frontend**: Modular JavaScript, with considerations for future framework integration

## Detailed Component Overview

### User Application

The User app manages all aspects related to user authentication, registration, and profile management. It offers a RESTful API for user operations.

### Courses Application

The Courses app is designed to facilitate academic course management and access. 

## Deployment and Configuration

### Nginx and HTTPS

Nginx serves as the web server and reverse proxy, configured to handle HTTPS connections. The configuration involves setting up SSL (self signed) certificate and directing HTTP traffic to HTTPS, ensuring all communications are secure.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the development phase, with core functionalities implemented and ongoing work to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience. Future updates will focus on:

- **Service Separation**: Refactoring the platform to support microservices architecture for improved scalability and maintenance.
- **Database Expansion**: Transitioning to a multi-database setup to optimize data management and storage solutions.
