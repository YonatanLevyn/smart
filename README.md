# Smart Platform

## Overview

Smart Platform is a prototype web application designed to enhance the educational experience for teachers and students. It facilitates knowledge sharing and the publishing of academic work, leveraging a modular architecture where each application component offers dedicated REST APIs. Developed with Django, the platform aims for scalability and ease of use, providing a robust framework for educational content management and collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Application Design**: Organized into distinct applications, each serving specific functionality through RESTful APIs.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tools and interfaces designed to promote the sharing of educational content among users.
- **Content Publishing**: Enables teachers and students to publish their academic work, making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Plans for further scalability include service separation, dedicated databases, reverse proxy integration, and message queue communication.

## Technologies

- **Backend Framework**: Django
- **APIs**: Django Rest Framework for building RESTful services
- **Database**: SQLite (with plans to expand to multiple database support)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (considerations for future expansion)
- **Deployment & Networking**: Plans for Docker containerization, reverse proxy setup, and message queue implementation for service communication

## Project Status

This project is currently in the development phase, with core functionalities implemented and ongoing work to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience. Future updates will focus on:

- **Service Separation**: Refactoring the platform to support microservices architecture for improved scalability and maintenance.
- **Database Expansion**: Transitioning to a multi-database setup to optimize data management and storage solutions.
- **Advanced Communication**: Implementing a message queue for efficient service-to-service communication.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Continuous improvements to the frontend to make the platform more intuitive and user-friendly.
